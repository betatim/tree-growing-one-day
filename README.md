# Machine-learning with trees

A one day course on machine-learning for beginners. Examples and practical
sections will us tree based models. However the model selection and
evaluation techniques apply equally to other types of models.

# Outline

* Introduction to decision trees
  - A single decision tree
  - forests, a simple and robust supervised models
    + "Kaggle challenges: if in doubt use xgboost" - _attribution_
  - classification
  - (regression)
  - "scoring" your model, is it better than guessing?

* Model selection
  - hyper-parameters?!
  - model complexity
  - how to choose hyper-parameters

* Model evaluation
  - how to evaluate your model
  - what to include in your cross-validation loop
  - unbiased estimates

* Model introspection
  - learn about your model
